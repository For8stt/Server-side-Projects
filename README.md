# Server-Side Project

### Project Description:
The goal of this project is to transform a client-side game into a server-side solution capable of managing multiple players and game sessions. The main objective is to implement the gameâ€™s logic and functionality on the server, handling requests from the client, and ensuring that the game can support multiple concurrent users with smooth communication between the client and server.  
The communication between the client and server is based on two primary technologies:  
- HTTP for user interactions  
- WebSockets for real-time updates of the game state.

### Core Features and Architecture:
1. **Server-Side Game Logic**
2. **WebSocket for Game State Updates**
3. **User Registration and Login**
